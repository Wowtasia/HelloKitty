      <h1>Hello Kitty!</h1>
      <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Hello Kitty</b>
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>:
        ハロー・キティ, Hepburn: <strong>ō Kiti</strong>),[6] also known by her
        full name <b>Kitty White</b> (キティ・ホワイト, Kiti Howaito),[5] is a
        fictional character produced by the Japanese company Sanrio,[7] created
        by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuko_Shimizu">Yuko Shimizu</a>
        and currently designed by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuko_Yamaguchi">Yuko Yamaguchi</a
        >. Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as a young female gijinka
        (anthropomorphization) of a Japanese Bobtail cat with a red bow and no
        mouth. [8] According to her backstory, she is a perpetual 3rd-grade
        student who lives outside of London.[9] <br />Kitty and her twin sister,
        Mimmy (depicted with a yellow bow), celebrate their birthday on 1
        November 1974.[10][11] Since the cartoon character's creation, the Hello
        Kitty media franchise has grown to include clothing, accessories, toys,
        games, books, manga, anime series, and music albums, along with other
        various product lines and media productions.

        Shortly after Hello Kitty's creation in 1974, the Hello Kitty vinyl coin
        purse was introduced by Sanrio in March 1975. Sanrio brought the
        character to the United States in 1976.[12][13] By 2010, Sanrio had
        turned Hello Kitty into a global marketing phenomenon,[14] worth $6
        billion a year.[15] By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old, she was
        worth about $8 billion a year.[16] Hello Kitty has become one of the
        highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

        Hello Kitty is a staple of the <i>kawaii</i> segment of Japanese popular
        culture.[17] First marketed toward pre-teenage girls, Hello Kitty's
        image found commercial success among not only her original target
        audience but adolescent and adult consumers as well. A variety of
        products ranging from school supplies to fashion accessories to motor
        oil[18] have featured the character over the years. A number of Hello
        Kitty TV series targeted towards children have been produced, as well as
        several manga comics and anime films. There are Sanrio theme parks based
        on Hello Kitty: Harmonyland in Hiji, Ōita, Japan;[19] Sanrio Puroland in
        Tama New Town, Tokyo, Japan; and the former Sanrio Hello Kitty Town in
